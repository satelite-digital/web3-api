<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![folder_preview.png](preview.png)

One of the use cases for NFTs and Web3 technologies that I believe could add value to many industries right now is the ability to use NFTs holding status as a factor of authentication.  

I recently learned about the #ClerkDev #thirdwebHackathon on #Hashnode and thought it would be a great opportunity to build tool that allows you to do just that.

The idea is to have a web application for you to create and manage application projects.  An application project holds information such as Name, Description, Success URL, Unauthorized URL, and also an API Key that gets generated automatically.  It will also hold a collection of rules such as:

- Wallet should hold any NFT of X collection
- Wallet should hold this specific TokenID from X collection

This way you are creating a security profile for NFT holders.  Then the project will also provide a React component you can instal on any project to import components that integrate with your application projects such as a "Sign In with Metamask" button.

### Built With

- ThirdWeb - AS Web3 SDK and service provider
- NextJS - As frontend application framework
- React - As frontend library
- DaisyUI - As UI library
- Node.js - Serverless functions runtime
- Vercel - Application hosting and serverless functions platform
- Prisma - ORM
- PlanetScale - Database
